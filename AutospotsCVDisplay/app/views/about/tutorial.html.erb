		<br><h4>Aquire image url from parking lot stream</h4>
		<p>
			A lot of parking web streams have a static image url you can input that will get the current

		<p>
			A raspberry pi can easily be configured to serve a image from a camera every so often and the
			url of that image you are updating on the server is the one we need to link to on the setup
